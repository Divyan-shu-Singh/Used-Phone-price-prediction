# Used-Phone-price-prediction

In today's world, people are always looking for ways to buy and sell used phones at the best price 
possible. With the rise of online marketplaces, buying and selling used phones has become more 
accessible. However, determining the right price for a used phone can still be a challenge. Predicting 
the price of a used phone accurately is a challenging task due to factors such as the phone's age, brand, 
model, condition, and market demand. That's where machine learning comes in!
In this project, a model is built that can predict the price of a used phone based on its features and 
specifications. This project will involve collecting and analyzing a dataset of used phone sales, feature 
engineering, and testing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms to identify the bestperforming model. This will help not only individual buyers and sellers make more informed 
decisions but also provide valuable insights for the broader used phone market.
